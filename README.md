Throughout this session I worked on the hologrphic desk and office chair I greatly improved the hologram adding lighting by dupelicating the original and adding a wireframe to the object that was made.
I also made a office chair that looks some what modern still needs work it involved lots of loop cuts to make the detail on the sides the whole thing at one point had sub modifier used to curve the sides
